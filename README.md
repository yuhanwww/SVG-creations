# SVG creations from the exploreCSR

This is a repo to record some of my SVG creations in the exploreCSR program @Brown Spring 2023!<br/>
Each i# stores a iteraion of creations, and the Iteration Logs recorded some of my inspirations, actions, and reflections.
Snippets from i1 to i8:<br/>

i1-i3 showcases the precision. i4-i6 showcases its flexibility to be blurry, random. i7-i8 incorporates animation within the SVG to create more interactive, visaully interesting depth and movement effects. Note that in i8, where I focused on the checkboard pattern with variaions of random shadow or whitespace movements, there is a python code that can generate randomly animation effects.

The SVG creations are all vector based, and I mainly explored the possibility of vector images in this exploritory research program. Vecotr images are precise, can be as random and blurry as pixel iamges, and most importantly, can combine animations in the image file, which extends the possibility of webpage backgrounds as it can be embedded in html with <svg> tags. 

At the end of the program, together with Pearl Zhang[^1], we coded a poster completely under <svg> tags to showcase the flexibility of SVG images and presented it on the Brown annual CS undergraduate research symposium.

### Abstract
Nowadays, a minimalist white blank background is very common in web design to highlight information, adapt various screen sizes and reduce development cost. If not a white background, impressional solid color, gradient, or photo background are mostly used, which mostly appear in a raster image. However, with the help of <svg> tag in html, we can create svg backgrounds with precise visual representations that are accessible, animatable, with the potential to be embedded in the web page without the need for additional loading. Pictures created in svg form are precise in vectors and will not lose quality in response to different sizes. With the help of inherent effects in <svg> , we can apply textures, transformations, and animations that provide a wide range of visual effects. Pictures coded in <svg> can be a new choice for web designers and can apply in many web applications like background or 3D scene, with the potential to bring back colorful unique web pages with different themes echoing the content.
